# Final-Project
====================  
Sabrina Dahl  
  
# Description  
This repository is where Sabrina Dahl will be creating an app for the final project of ST 558. The dataset used will be "Hipertension Arterial Mexico" which predicts whether the individual will have hypertension based on the collected variables. We will first perform an Exploratory Data Analysis. The app will then be able to create two models and prediction whether an individual is at risk or not at risk of having hypertension based on those models.
